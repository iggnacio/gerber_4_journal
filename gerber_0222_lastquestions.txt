We will have a test on Friday.
It will be about the notes from last week.
Are you ready? 
What specific questions do you have about the Slick Game?
We will be revising our Slick game to:
1. Have multiple levels
2. Enemies
3. Traps (or something) with coordinates defined by an array.
4. Give and take damage
5. Score
6. Inventory or some compelling alternative.
What will you have to do to get this working?
Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need? 
If not be specific.
