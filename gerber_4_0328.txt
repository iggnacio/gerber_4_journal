What is required for a circuit?

Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from them. Descriptions should be _at least_ one full paragraph in length.

You will be completing your own project - a project of your own design that accepts user input and provides light and sound in some way.
i will create a radio comunication device to comunicaate with sattilites and other radios
Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make. [Note - 'none' is not a valid answer. For example, there is a 'Simon' game provided - using that code would earn a '0' because it is 0% your code.]
i will have to use i2c tom comunicate with all the componets of my device to rellay messages between radios
